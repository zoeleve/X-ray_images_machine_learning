# X-ray_images_machine_learning
Intelligent system to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images
Consider the following steps:
1. Explore the data and define appropriate classes
2. Visualize data and employ appropriate preprocessing to X-ray images
3. Develop the detection algorithms
1. Using features and classical machine learning techniques
2. Using a neural network architecture 
4. Present the results of your algorithms (confusion matrix, accuracy, etc.)
